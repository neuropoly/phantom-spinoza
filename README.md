## Tips

Phantom shell construction:
- Remove all 3D-printin supports and residues from all surfaces.
- Smooth surfaces carefully by sanding.
- Waterproof inner surfaces with epoxy (e.g., Smooth-On XTC-3D). 
- Glue the two parts of the shell together with epoxy or by plastic welding.
- Reinforce exterior surfaces with epoxy and fiberglass.
- Wash the inside of the phantom thoroughly.

Mixture preparation:
- Ensure that no contaminating particles can fall into the mixture.
- Place large container on a hot plate and add water.
- Turn the hot plate on and wait for temperature to reach 60deg.
- Start stirring and do not stop during the whole process. Avoid splashing. 
- Add salt and dissolve it.
- Add sugar gradually, dissolving each portion.
- Add agar when the temperature has reached 90 deg and dissolve it.
- Turn hot plate off. Continue stirring. 
- Add mouthwash and stir for a few minutes to homogenize the mixture.
- Continue stirring for some time to prevent the mixture from burning at the bottom of the container.
- Wait for temp to reach 60 deg.
- Pour the mixture into the phantom avoiding bubbles.
